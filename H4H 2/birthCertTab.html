					<div class="content">
						If you must get documents by themselves, then  you will need to find a notary who will verify their identity with the ID they have on hand, such as CDCR (prison or parole ID) ID, public benefits cards, or witnesses confirming their identity. 
						<p>
							Tip: If a person does not have local contacts to confirm identity, the person can ask parole or probation officer (and their supervisor or other colleague, if they need a second person) to confirm their identity

						i. When a form is mailed in, it requires a notary to confirm identity, which could be an additional fee (some banks will offer notary services free if a person has a bank account)
						<p>
						ii. Fee waivers are available if a person is homeless with this form: <a href ="https://ccr.saccounty.net/Documents/AffidavitHomelessStatus.pdf">CCR form.</a> The form must be signed by a homeless service provider (this includes transitional housing providers). Catholic Charities, parole, and probation may be able to provide signed fee waivers.
